Quick Description: Lesson took from MDN website to practice HTML skills. Feel free to leave a comment, thanks!

I'm aspiring to become a front-end web developer. I've read/watched some great stories about people making career changes and turning their whole life around. My interest in coding was sparked along time ago. I feel like I have matured enough mentally to embark on this journey to become a professional in the field. It will be an arduous journey, but I know I'm not alone.
